First, you should clone the repository to the desktop. Once the repository is on your computer, open up the folder using netbeans. The server and db will be created in the DBConnect.java file, so you can plug and play this application. Netbeans will sometimes complain about the library, but all of the .jar files you need for the library is in the Nudge/dist/lib folder. I would make a copy of the .jar files in the Nudge/dist/lib folder because running a clean and build will sometimes cause you to lose that folder.
