# TrackerAppProtoOne
Prototyping tracker application. First, navigate to the downloaded folder through the NetBeans IDE. After you found the correct folder, the testing and fun can begin. The first database I have used requires you to manually start the server. To complete this, you should look at the picture named Server_Start_Pic.PNG. This image will show you where to navigate to start the server. To start the server, you should right-click the Java DB database. Then, select start. Once this is started, you can return to the netbeans Projects area and run the program. I have implemented a user login, create user, and started a little bit with the Calendar GUI just to show the transition. I haven't commented much, but I will go back and do this. If you look at my UML diagram, you will notice a Users and Tasks Java class that haven't been written. I believe this would probably be the next thing to start on, and we should also flesh out the Calander GUI more for next week. If we decide to use the database this way, I will ask the professor if he can start it manually. We can always implement an embedded database or figure out how to start the database with code if he has a problem with starting the server manually.
